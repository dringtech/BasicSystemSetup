# These pacakges provide the necessary information for Homebrew 
# to install and manage various software packages and applications.

# Homebrew can manage 3 kind of apps
# 'brew' will be used for CLI software
# 'mas' will be used for Mac App Store software
# 'cask' will be used for all the apps not available on the app store

# The brew command will fetch and execute installation instructions from homebrew
# those instructions are called formulae
# "mas" stands for MacAppStore, this package allows homebrew to install apps from the mac store
brew "mas"
# "zsh-autosuggestions" will enable terminal suggestions based on you command history
# this formulae requires the ~/.zshrc to be modified, this repo includes a script
# that will automatically set up this.
brew 'zsh-autosuggestions'

# Once "mas" is installed we can use that command to install apps from the app store

# For this example we are only installing "The Unarchiver", 
# which is a file compressor/decompressor, like a Mac winzip
#mas "Drafts", id: 1435957248
mas "The Unarchiver", id: 425424353
# mas "Keynote", id: 409183694
# mas "Numbers", id: 409203825
# mas "Pages", id: 409201541

# I have commented the other apps, but feel free to uncomment them and add your own
# The "app name string" is used for identification, while 
# the id ensures the correct app is installed from the Mac App Store via Homebrew.
# You can find the app id by looking for your app on the AppStore, sharing as a link
# and in the link you'll find a number, that is the app id
# Example: https://apps.apple.com/mx/app/keynote/id409183694


# Most of the cool apps are not available from the AppStore
# For those we use the cask command

# For this example we'll only install Chrome
# cask "google-chrome"
# cask "visual-studio-code"
# cask "microsoft-edge"
# cask "docker"
# cask "zoom"
# cask "miro"
# cask "figma"

# Uncomment all that you want or you could also search for 
# any app you want on https://brew.sh/ to get the cask id
